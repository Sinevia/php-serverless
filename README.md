## INSTALLATION ##

1. Step 1
```
composer create-project --prefer-dist sinevia/php-serverless .
```

2. Step 2
```
vendor/bin/robo init
```

## AFTER INSTALLATION ##
- Delete the phpunit.xml file, if you are not going to use PHPUnit for testing
- Change the settings in /app/config (serverless function name, etc)
- Change the settings in /env.php (not required usually)

## WORKFLOW ##
Four environments are specified and available out of the box - local, testing, staging, live.

1. Local. All development is done on local - (local)
2. Testing. Automatic tests are run in testing - (testing)
3. Staging. For user and manual testing depoy to staging - (staging)
4. Live. For real live usage deploy to live - (live)

## DEVELOPMENT ##

To start working on the project run the built in PHP server:

```
php -S localhost:32222
```

or using the helper function

```
vendor/bin/robo serve
```

Then open in browser: http://localhost:32222/

or using the helper function

```
vendor/bin/robo open local
```


## DATABASE ##

To run migrations for each environment:

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate local
```

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate staging
```

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate live
```



## DEPLOYMENT ##

The deployment will run your tests, and will continue only if your tests are successful

To deploy to your staging function
```
vendor/bin/robo deploy staging
```

To deploy to your live function
```
vendor/bin/robo deploy live
```

## HELPER FUNCTIONS ##

A RoboFile exists with automated functionality.

- Run database migrations on local

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate local
```

- Run database migrations on staging

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate local
```

- Run database migrations on live

```
vendor/bin/robo migrate live
```

- Serve the site for development

```
vendor/bin/robo serve
```

- Open local/dev url from terminal

```
vendor/bin/robo open local
```

- Open staging url from terminal

```
vendor/bin/robo open staging
```

- Open live url from terminal

```
vendor/bin/robo open live
```

- Deploy to staging

```
vendor/bin/robo deploy staging
```

- Deploy to live

```
vendor/bin/robo deploy live
```


## TESTING ##

Two testing frameworks supported out of the box:
1. Testify.php - very lean and straghtforward to work with (preferred, and preinstaled)
2. PHPUnit - more mature, but heavy weight with many dependencies

To decide which modify the setting in the RoboFile.


### Testing with Testify.php ###

Testify is a small PHP testing library with no extenal dependencies: https://github.com/BafS/Testify.php

Place your tests in /tests/test.php

To run the tests

```
php tests/test.php
```
or
```
vendor/bin/robo test
```

### Testing with PHPUnit ###

PHPUnit is a huge PHP testing library. Beware it will come with lots of composer dependencies: https://phpunit.de/

To install the framework with all the dependencies

```
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

Place your settigs in /phpunit.xml. Place your tests in /tests

To run the tests

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
or
```
vendor/bin/robo test
```


## SERVING STATIC FILES ##

Multiple options

Local CSS and JavaScript files are best to be served minified inline. Helper functions are added

```
<?php echo joinCss(['/css/main.css','/css/secondary.css']); ?>
```

Small images (i.e. favicon) serve inline as data.

```
<img src="<?php echo image2DataUri('/public/img/avatar.png'); ?>" />
```

To serve static files separately place them in the public directory.

```
/public/css/main.css
```

For remote static files use CDN, S3 or other storage.

### req($name, $default = null, $functions = []) ###
Returns the requested $_REQUEST name-value pair if it exists

### sess($name, $default = null, $functions = [], $options = []) ###
Returns the requested $_SESSION name-value pair if it exists

### once($name, $default = null, $functions = [], $options = []) ###

### function reqOrSess($name, $default = null, $functions = []) ###

### ui($view, $vars = array(), $options = array()) ###
